/* 
   Implement (define) a class for an Employee at a LawFirm.
   
   Every employee's state should include:
      - an ID number (default 0)
      - a name (default "Employee 0")
      - a number of hours they work a week (default 40)
      - a base salary (default $40,000.00)
      - a number of vacation days (default 10)
      - a color of the form they need to complete to take vacay (default yellow)
      
   You should be able to create an Employee with all deafult values OR with specific value
   passed to the constructor for name only.
   
   You should be able to access all fields, but only change hours worked, salary, and vacation days.
   
   You should be able to print an Employee object using System.out.println.
   e.g. System.out.println(new Employee()); should print an Employee in a logical way.
