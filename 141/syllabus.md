<h1>CS141 - CS I (Java 1)</h1>
<p>This course provides an introduction to programming using the Java programming language. We will explore common computational problem-solving techniques useful to computer scientists, but also to anyone who has large data sets, repetitive processes or other needs for computation.</p>
<p>Due to the amount of material and quick pace for consumption, prior programming experience is expected either through CS121 or other Instructor Approved demonstration.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> ENGL&amp; 101 (may be taken concurrently) and MATH&amp; 141 or MATH 111 with grades of 2.0 or better. CS 121 or ENGR 202 with a grade of 2.0 or better.</p>

<h3>Classroom Contract</h3>
<p>You are expected to uphold the classroom contract as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be Prepared</strong>: You are expected to complete all pre-work and homework before class starts so that you are ready to be engaged in conversations and activities.</li>
<li><strong>Be Present</strong>: You are expected to be in class, on time, and actively present in the learning process.</li>
<li><strong>Create space for learning:&nbsp;</strong>You are expected to create and cultivate&nbsp;a space where learning is condusive for all learners. This means that while you are expected to be an active participant in the classroom, you are also expected to leave space for others who are learning as well. Do not answer every question that is asked of the class, nor should you dominate small group exercises. You should both listen and speak during activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic honesty and integrity is expected. Shoreline Community College has a strict policy on cheating and plagiarism. You are cheating if you copy, steal, borrow, consult, or use any means to obtain answers from classmates or unauthorized sources for any assignment inside or ourside class. Any student found guilty of cheating and/or plagiarism will receive a zero for the assignment. If it happens a second time, you may&nbsp;fail the course.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Programming Homework must be completed individually</h3>
<p>All code you submit must be your own work. You may discuss general ideas of how to approach an assignment, but never specific details about the code to write. Any help you receive from or provide to classmates should be limited and should never involve details of how to code a solution. It should also not be in front of a computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>may not</strong> work as a partner with another student on an assignment.</li>
<li>You <strong>may not</strong> show another student your solution to an assignment for any reason.</li>
<li>You <strong>may not</strong> look at another's&nbsp;solution for any reason.</li>
<li>You <strong>may not</strong> have another person "walk you through" an assignment, describe in detail how to solve it, or sit with you as you write it. You also may not provide such help to another student. This includes tutor and current or former students.</li>
<li>You <strong>may not</strong> post your homework solution code online to ask others for help. This includes public message boards, forums, file sharing sites and services, or any other online system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that <strong>both parties involved in a cheating case are treated equally</strong>. That is, helping someone else cheat is just as bad as reading someone else&rsquo;s solution. There are many resources for students who are struggling, and the right thing to do in this situation is to point them to these resources.</p>
<h2>How to be Successful in this Course</h2>
<p>Tips to be successful in this course:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Come to class:</strong> Participating in class lectures and practice problems will give you structured time to absorb new concepts, practice them, and ask questions to the Instructor and your peers.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for help early:</strong>&nbsp;In programming, everything stacks, meaning what you learn today, you WILL use tomorrow. Therefore, if you start to fall behind, it is imperative that you ask for help as soon as possible.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Practice:</strong> It is not enough in programming to just read about or listen to lectures about&nbsp;concepts. It is important to solve problems both in-class and on your own. You should work through practice problems (like on PracticeIt) until you are able to solve them without the aide of another person.</li>
<li><strong>Utilize the textbook, slides, and videos provided:</strong> While lecture will cover most of the concepts, the textbook, slides, and videos provided will provide more detail and reference outside of class.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting Unstuck</h3>
<p>You&nbsp;WILL get stuck; getting stuck is part of the programming experience. Part of this course is&nbsp;developing skills to get unstuck.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step back:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>When you first get stuck, take a deep breath! Step back for a moment. Look carefully at the work you have just done. Try changing one thing and see what effect it has.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Talk to a rubberduck:&nbsp;</strong>No really, this is actually<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">a thing</a>. Sometimes if you take a moment to tell someone (even someone non-techie) what you're trying to do, you'll end up having an Ah-Ha moment of clarity!</li>
<li><strong>Work in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)">sandbox</a>:</strong><span>&nbsp;Open a new file and try some small snippets of code to see what they do. Make sure you understand the components that you are using in your program separately so that you can better understand how they work together.</span></li>
<li><strong>Take a break:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Sometimes you just need to take a break! Looking at code with a fresh set of eyes solves problems quicker than beating your head against the computer :)</li>
<li><strong>Talk to a peer:</strong>&nbsp;It is OK, even encouraged, to talk to your peers about concepts in class, however, do&nbsp;not to violate rules for individual programming homework.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Ask&nbsp;the Instructor:&nbsp;</strong>I'm here to help you.<span>&nbsp;</span>It's&nbsp;literally my job.
<ul>
<li><strong>Office Hours:</strong>&nbsp;Come prepared to discuss what you are trying to do and what you've tried.</li>
<li><strong>Send me a message on Canvas:</strong>&nbsp;Be sure to summarize&nbsp;<span>what you are trying to do and what you've tried.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
