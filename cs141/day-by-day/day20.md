# Day 20/20

+ Final Practice
  - With a pair they haven't worked with before, work on one of the practice midterms on practice it.
  - Goals are to review concepts and also to practice talking about code and code logic out loud
  - Make a notes to study sheet where you record the types of things you need to remember about each type of problem that you will see on the final.

## Example for Notes Sheet

1. Array Mystery
 - Pay attention to starting index (`0`? `1`? something else?)
 - Pay attention to ending index (`< a.length`? `< a.length -1`?)
 - What's happening with the incrementing? Counting up (`i++`)? Counting Down (`i--`)? Something else?
 - Remember to track the changes that are happening in the array! The array is dynamic! Don't use old values for the processing.

2. Reference Mystery
 - Arrays, ArrayLists, and Objects are passed by reference. This means that they change permanently when changed in a method.
 - Primitive Data Types (int, double, char) do NOT change permanently when changed in a method (their changes only appear in the method in which they are changed.)

3. Inheritance Mystery
  - When you extend a class, you inherit all the fields and methods from the class that is extended
  - To access methods in a parent class, use `super.`
  - To access methods in the class you are in, use `this.`
  - If neither `this.` nor `super.` is specified, the program will try to find the method in the original class type (not necessarily the one it's being called from). If it doesn't exist, it will move up the inheritance hierarchy the way it usually does.

4. Token-based processing
  - Do not use `nextLine()`, read in individual
