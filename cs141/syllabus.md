## Major Student Learning Objectives
Outcomes:
1. Analyze and explain syntax, semantics, and practical effects of programming statements and procedures.
1. Recognize and use coding patterns and programming language constructs such as sequence, selection, iteration, and procedures.
1. **Solve problems given an algorithm.**
1. **Begin to design and implement solutions to ambiguous problems.**
1. Recognize and use test cases to verify that solutions meet specifications.
1. Analyze reasoning, design and effectiveness of alternative solutions.

Students should be able to:
- use _pseudocode_ to plan code
- identify, create, and use _variables_, _data types_, _methods_, _conditionals_, _definite and indefinite loops_, _arrays_, _parameters_, _Objects_
- break down problems into logical pieces using methods and Objects
- _test_ code
- _debug_ code
- read and work with unfamiliar code

## Prerequisites
Prerequisite: ENGL& 101 (may be taken concurrently) and MATH& 141 or MATH 111 with grades of 2.0 or better. CS 121 or ENGR 202 with a grade of 2.0 or better.

## Classroom Contract
You are expected to uphold the classroom contract as follows:
- **Be Prepared**: You are expected to complete all pre-work and homework before class starts so that you are ready to be engaged in conversations and activities.
- **Be Present**: You are expected to be in class, on time, and actively present in the learning process.
- **Participate**: You are expected to be an active contributor in class. This means both asking questions and helping others.
  + Do you make at least one contribution (e.g. insight or question) to each class without monopolizing discussion?
  + Do you give active non-verbal and verbal feedback?
  + Do you refer to other students by name and react to their contributions?

## Academic Integrity
Academic honesty and integrity is expected. Shoreline Community College has a strict policy on cheating and plagiarism. You are cheating if you copy, steal, borrow, consult, or use any means to obtain answers from classmates or unauthorized sources for any assignment inside or ourside class. Any student found guilty of cheating and/or plagiarism will receive a zero for assignment. If it happens a second time, you will fail the course. Please see the Shoreline Dishonesty in Academics Policy (#5033) [here](https://www.shoreline.edu/currentstudents/student-policies.aspx)

### Programming HW must be completed individually
All code you submit must be your own work. You may discuss general ideas of how to approach an assignment, but never specific details about the code to write. Any help you receive from or provide to classmates should be limited and should never involve details of how to code a solution. It should also not be in front of a computer.

**Here are some do’s and don’ts:**
- DO NOT work as a partner with another student on an assignment.
- DO NOT show (or send!) you solution to another person for any reason at any time. EVER.
- DO NOT look at someone else’s solution.
- DO NOT post any piece of solution code anywhere online (on Canvas, on message boards, forums, file sharing sites and services, or any other online system).

Please note that both parties involved in a cheating case are treated equally. That is, helping someone else cheat is just as bad as reading someone else’s solution. There are many resources for students who are struggling, and the right thing to do in this situation is to point them to these resources.

## Students with Disabilities
Shoreline Community College is committed to providing educational programs without regard to disabling conditions as defined by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Reasonable accommodations will be made and no otherwise qualified individual with disabling conditions shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program, activity or service administered by the college.
