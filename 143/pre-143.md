# Preparing for CS II (CS 143)

## Reviewing CS I (CS 141) material

Computer Science is a subject where you typically learn by doing. This means that you also tend to forget by _not doing_. If it has been a quarter or few since you took CS I, it is recommended that you review CS I material prior to CS II. One way that you can do this is by working through several problems in each chapter of Building Java Programs - Chapters 1 through 10 on [codestepbystep.com](https://www.codestepbystep.com/r/problem/list/java).

It is expected that coming into CS 143 you are _already comfortable with_ the following concepts:
  - using pseudocode to plan code
  - identifying, creating, and using variables, data types, methods (including parameters and returns), conditionals, definite and indefinite loops, arrays, ArrayLists, Object Oriented Programming (making classes and inheritance)
  - breaking down problems into logical pieces using methods
  - testing and debugging code
  - reading and working with unfamiliar code

## Why Preview CS 143 Material?

Previewing material allows you to to gain exposure to a concept before tackling the computational thinking behind the concept. When you see material at a high level beforehand, you are able to become familiar with vocabulary and reflect on how this new concept relates to the concepts you already know.

The purpose of previewing material is NOT to understand the material at 100%.

The purpose of previewing material is to gain a high level understanding of the concept.

## CS 143 Preview Guiding Questions

Below is a collection of guiding questions that you should try to answer as you preview material.

- What is a Collection?
  - List one example of a Java Collection.
- What is Recursion?
  - What is a base case?
  - What is a recursive case?
- Name two searching algorithms.
- Name two sorting algorithms.
- What is Big-O (Efficiency)?
  - Why is it important?
- What is a stack?
  - Name two characteristics of a stack.
- What is a queue?
  - Name two characteristics of a queue.
- What is a linked list?
  - How is a linked list stored differently in memory than a (native) array.
  - What two things are contained inside a List Node?
- What is a tree?
  - What three things are contained inside a Binary Tree Node?
