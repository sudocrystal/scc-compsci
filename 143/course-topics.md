## CS 141 Review + Advanced Material

We will review material from CS 141 as well as build upon that knowledge. While it is an expectation that you are entering this course with knowledge of material covered in chapters 1 through 10 of our textbook, we will focus on reviewing material from Chapters 7 through 10 and cover a few topics that were not covered in Shoreline's offering of CS 141 (but are present in the text). 

Textbook sections: Chapters 1-10, focus on 7.5, 9.2-9.5, 10.2

## Implementation, Sets & Maps, Big-O

We will learn about the data structures Set and Map, discuss the concept of implementation versus abstraction, and start thinking about the efficiency of our code. 

Textbook sections: 15.1, 15.2, 11.2, 11.3, 13.2

## Searching & Sorting

We will learn about different sorting and searching algorithms. You will not need to memorize the code for these algorithms, but you are expected to understand the state of the data after each "pass" of the algorithm for Insertion and Selection sort and be able to show the process of splitting and merging of the algorithm for merge sort.

Textbook sections: 13.1, 13.3, 13.4

## Recursion

We will learn about recursion - the idea of a method calling itself. We will begin by learning about recursive tracing, which is following the calls that are made in recursion. Then we will move into writing recursive methods and recursive backtracking.

Textbook sections: 12.1, 12.2, 12.5

## Iterators, Generics, Stacks & Queues

We will learn about iterators which allow you to traverse through a data structure that is not index-able (such as Set, Map, Stack, and Queue). We will also learn about using generics and E to allow a data structure that we create to hold data of different types. And last, we will explore two new data structures - Stack and Queue. 

Textbook sections: 11.1, 15.3, 15.4, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3

## Linked Lists

We will learn about a data type called a LinkedList which is comprised of ListNodes. A linked list is stored as non-contiguous memory with pointers to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are generally singly-linked, doubly-linked, and/or circularly-linked.

Textbook sections: 16.1, 16.2, 16.5

## Trees

We will learn about the tree data structure. Trees are comprised of nodes like linked lists; however, trees have pointers to more than one node and generally are represented in a hierarchical way. Binary trees are special trees where each node has 0-2 children. Binary search trees are special binary trees which enforce a left child to have data that is considered smaller than the parent and a right child to have data greater that is considered larger than the parent. We will learn to traverse trees, manipulate data in Trees/TreeNodes, and manipulate the pointers of TreeNodes.

Textbook sections: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4
