# Major Course Objectives (MCOs)

## CS121 MCOs (Pre-CS1, CS0)
Outcomes:
1. Analyze and explain syntax, semantics, and practical effects of programming statements and procedures.
1. Recognize and use coding patterns and programming language constructs such as sequence, selection, iteration, and procedures.
1. **Solve small, independent problems given an algorithm.**
1. Recognize and use test cases to verify that solutions meet specifications.
1. Analyze reasoning, design and effectiveness of alternative solutions.

Students should be able to:
- use _pseudocode_ to plan code
- identify, create, and use _variables_
- identify, create, and use _functions_
- identify, create, and use _conditionals_ (if/elif/else)
- identify, create, and use _loops_ (while/for)
- identify, create, and use _strings_ and associated operations
- identify, create, and use _lists_
- identify and use _classes_ and _objects_
- _test_ code
- _debug_ code
- read and work with unfamiliar code
