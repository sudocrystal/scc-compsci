# Major Course Objectives (MCOs)

## CS121 MCOs
Outcomes:
1. Use computational models to solve problems.
1. Solve problems given an algorithm.
1. Apply systematic, mathematically-based problem-solving strategies, using programming language constructs suchs as sequence, selection, iteration, and procedures.
1. Analyze reasoning, design and effectiveness of alternative solutions.
1. Design experiments to test alternative solutions and determine if they meet specifications.
1. Analyze and explain syntax, semantics, and practical effects of programmings statements and procedures.

Students should be able to:
- use _pseudocode_ to plan code
- identify, create, and use _variables_
- create and use _functions_
- utilize _conditionals_ (if/elif/else)
- utilize _loops_ (while/for)
- use and manipulate _strings_ and associated operations
- create and use _lists_
- identify _classes_ and _objects_
- _test_ code
- _debug_ code
- read and work with unfamiliar code
