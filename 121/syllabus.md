<h2>Classroom Contract</h2>
<p>You are expected to uphold the classroom contract as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be Prepared</strong>: You are expected to complete all pre-work and homework before class starts so that you are ready to be engaged in conversations and activities.</li>
<li><strong>Be Present</strong>: You are expected to be in class, on time, and actively present in the learning process.</li>
<li><strong>Participate</strong>: You are expected to be an active contributor in class. This means both asking questions and helping others.
<ul>
<li>Do you make at least one contribution (e.g. insight or question) to each class without monopolizing discussion?</li>
<li>Do you give active non-verbal and verbal feedback?</li>
<li>Do you refer to other students by name and react to their contributions?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Create space for learning: </strong>You are expected to create and cultivate a space where learning is conducive for all learners.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Unstuck</h2>
<p>You WILL get stuck. It happens to everyone -- nobody is immune. However, one of the most useful skills you may learn from this course is "how to get unstuck."</p>
<p>In the real world, successful people who find themselves stuck do several things such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>systematically play around with the technology,</li>
<li>ask a co-worker or friend for help, or</li>
<li>ask an expert for help.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully you'll explore all three means to get unstuck in this course. This process is called "debugging" and we'll talk more about this sort of strategy during the course.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step back.</strong> When you first "get stuck," take a deep breath! Step back for a moment. Look carefully at the work you have just done. Try changing one thing and see what effect it has.</li>
<li><strong>Talk to a rubberduck.</strong>No really, this is actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">a thing</a>. Sometimes if you take a moment to tell someone (even someone non-techie) what you're trying to do, you'll end up having an Ah-Ha moment of clarity!</li>
<li><strong>Ask a classmate.</strong> Try to share ideas about how to figure out the problem rather than telling your classmate the answer. You'll learn as much by helping others find their mistakes as you will by finding your own.</li>
<li><strong>Take a break.</strong> Sometimes you just need to take a break! Looking at code with a fresh set of eyes solves problems quicker than beating your head against the computer :)</li>
<li><strong>Ask the Instructor. </strong>I'm here to help you. It's literally my job.
<ul>
<li><strong>Office Hours.</strong> Come prepared to discuss what you are trying to do and what you've tried.</li>
<li><strong>Email.</strong> Yes! Email is a thing. Use it to ask for help. Be sure to summarize what you are trying to do and what you've tried.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
