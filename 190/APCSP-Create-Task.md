# Create Task

## 2a - Video and Response

> “Provide a written response or audio narration in your video that: w identifies the programming language; identifies the purpose of your program; and explains what the video illustrates.” 

_(Must not exceed 150 words)_


## 2b - Developing a Program with a Purpose

> “Describe the incremental and iterative development process of your program, focusing on two distinct points in that process. Describe the difficulties and/or opportunities you encountered and how they were resolved or incorporated. In your description clearly indicate whether the development described was collaborative or independent. At least one of these points must refer to independent program development. 

_(Must not exceed 200 words)_


## 2c - Applying Algorithms

> “Capture and paste a program code segment that implements an algorithm (marked with an oval in section 3 below) and that is fundamental for your program to achieve its intended purpose. This code segment must be an algorithm you developed individually on your own, must include two or more algorithms, and must integrate mathematical and/or logical concepts. Describe how each algorithm within your selected algorithm functions independently, as well as in combination with others, to form a new algorithm that helps to achieve the intended purpose of the program.”

_(Must not exceed 200 words)_

## 2d - Applying Abstraction

> “Capture and paste a program code segment that contains an abstraction you developed individually on your own (marked with a rectangle in section 3 below). This abstraction must integrate mathematical and logical concepts. Explain how your abstraction helped manage the complexity of your program. 

_(Must not exceed 200 words)_
