# Tips for being an Effective Tutor

1. **Cultivate independence**
  - Demonstrate HOW to do something (not the assignment exactly) and then ask the student to re-teach you.
    - For example, if a student is trying to make a loop that prints the numbers 1-10, use a "sandbox" to show them how to write a loop that runs from 0-5. Explain to them how the loop works and have them explain it back to you. Then ask them, "how could we change this loop to run for 1-10?" ("Which part of the loop controls what the starting value is?", "Which part of the loop controls when the loop ends?", ...)
  - Make sure the student is the one actually doing the work (i.e. Don't just take over! Let the student "drive" the keyboard.)
  - When possible, answer questions with questions.
    - For example: The student asks "How do I make this repeat 5 times?". Respond with ""
1. **Be a good listener**
  - Listen to what the student is asking for help with. Make sure you know the student’s current learning goals and current questions.
  - Ask for explanations of answers—particularly incorrect ones. Try to lead students to identifying their own misconceptions when possible.
  - Observe nonverbal cues (they might verbally say they get it, but do their body cues say the same?)
  - _Answer the question_: Your experience will enable you to see potential complications and inefficiencies in a student’s approach or code before the student does. Don’t deflect the conversation toward those unearthed issues. Work with the student to address their immediate concerns.
   - _Be OK with not knowing all the answers_: If a student asks a question you cannot answer, don’t be afraid to tell them you don’t know the answer.
  - If you hear the same question numerous times, please let the instructor know! This may mean something needs to be retaught in the classroom to all students.
1. **Offer praise and encouragement, but without being phony**
  - Acknowledge progress, even if there are still struggles/errors
  - Never ridicule incorrect answers
  - _Share your own struggles and strategies_: Show students how you find answers when you’re stuck, what resources are valuable to you, and how to evaluate the quality of potential solutions or explanations.
1. **Provide constructive feedback**
  - _Be kind_: Give comments with care and kindness; learning new things is hard!
  - _Describe, Don’t Evaluate_: Feedback should describe, rather than judge, a student’s work.
    - For example, "You’ve broken this problem down into really good functions that eliminate redundancy of code and allows for specific code functionality testing" rather than "This code looks good" (which is a judgment and doesn’t describe what makes the code "good".)
  - _Be Specific, Not General_: Give specific comments rather than general ones. For example, "In this section of code we could eliminate some of the loops if we..." rather than "This algorithm could be more efficient."
  - Use the "sandwich" approach
    - 1) Say something that worked well, 2) Offer a constructive suggestion for improvement, and 3) Mention another aspect that worked well.
    - For example, "I like how your variable names are meaningful, but I think this variable is not storing what the name claims it is storing. Overall, the breakdown of the code is really readable though!"
    - This approach will build a student’s confidence levels while they are developing their skills.
  - _Pace feedback_: Only provide feedback to students at a rate they can integrate. For example, work on perhaps one main issue per session and suggest one way to strengthen the code.
1. **Check Understanding**
  - Ask the student to paraphrase what you’ve explained. Sometimes if the student verbalizes it, it can either affirm understanding or lead to additional questions.
  - Offer additional examples/questions to "quiz" the student
  - Aim for improvement and long-term growth—not perfection!
  - Help them do the best work THEY can do (not the best YOU can do)
1. **Reflect on your tutoring session**
  - While part of your job as a tutor is to provide helpful suggestions to students, you can also solicit their input on your feedback. For example, "What’s working for you in my explanations? How might I improve my delivery to better assist you?"
