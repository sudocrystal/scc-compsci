# Programming Homework Help Guide Sheet

If you are stuck on your long program homework, use this guide to help you get unstuck!

## 1. Understand the Task and the Goal

Before seeking help:

- **Read the assignment prompt completely** at least twice.
- Write down the **main goal** in your own words.
- Identify any **specific outputs or requirements** given in the prompt.
- Note which **topics or concepts** from class are expected to be used (e.g., loops, arrays, file I/O).

Example: 

- **Prompt:** “The program should read a list of student grades from a file, calculate the average, and print results with proper formatting.”
- **Topics Expected to use:** files, loop, methods

  
## 2. Identify Where You’re Stuck

Be specific when explaining your challenge to a tutor:

- **What part** of the homework? (e.g., reading the file, computing the result, formatting output)
- **What is not working?** (e.g., program crashes, incorrect output, syntax error)

Examples:

- “The file read code compiles, but the data is not being stored in the array.”
- “My loop doesn’t process all items; it stops too early.”


## 3. Note What You’ve Already Tried

Before getting help, list:

- Steps or approaches you’ve attempted.
- Any changes you made to the original code.
- What debugging or testing you’ve run (e.g., printing variables to check values).

Example:

- “I used `Scanner` with `nextLine()`—works for the first line but not for others.”
- “I added print statements inside the loop to check indices.”


## 4. Gather Materials for Asking for Help

To help your tutor or instructor assist efficiently:

- Have the homework prompt ready.
- Have your code open and ready to review.
- Show **error messages** or unexpected output as they appear.
- Be ready to describe your coding approach.


## 5. Suggested Steps During the Help Session

1. **Briefly explain the assignment goal in your own words.**
2. **Name the topics** you believe are involved.
3. **Identify the exact spot** and nature of the problem.
4. **Share what you’ve tried** and what happened.
5. **Ask targeted questions**: “How can I store data from multiple lines of a file?” rather than “I don’t get it.”

***
**Key Reminder:** Tutors and instructors can guide your thinking, but you will do the actual work. The clearer you are, the more effective your help session will be.
