# Shoreline Computer Science Courses

## [CS121](121/) Introduction to Programming - Python (Pre-CS1, CS0)
This course provides an introduction to computer programming. Explore foundational programming constructs, such as variables, functions, decisions, loops, and lists. Explore foundational programming concepts, such as problem solving, testing, and debugging. This course is intended for students with little to no prior programming experience.

### Outcomes
1. **Develop solutions to small-scale problems given an algorithm, such as computing the cost of an item dependent on a few variable choices or calculating and applying a curve to a classroom of grades.**
1. Examine and explain syntax, semantics, and practical effects of programming statements and procedures.
1. Identify and use programming language constructs such as sequence, selection, iteration, and procedures.
1. Recognize and use test cases to verify that solutions meet specifications.
1. Examine and compare reasoning, design, and effectiveness of alternative solutions.

### Course Outline and Topics
Key topics:
1. Introduction to computing (hardware, software, algorithms)
1. Variables, Expressions, Statements
1. Functions
1. Conditionals
1. Loops
1. String and string operations
1. Lists

Optional:
- Programming Robots
- Graphics

## [CS141](141/) Computer Science I - Java (CS1)
This course will explore common computational problem-solving techniques useful to computer scientists, but also to anyone who has large data sets, repetitive processes or other needs for computation. Topics include: fundamental programming-in-the-small abilities and concepts, including procedural programming (methods, parameters, return, values), basic control structures (sequence, if/else, for loop, while loop), file processing, arrays, and an introduction to defining objects.

Due to the amount of material and quick pace for consumption, prior programming experience is expected.

### Outcomes
1. **Develop solutions to small-scale problems, such as determining the best candidate for an admissions process, analyzing text for keywords, or playing a game of word guess.**
1. **Design and implement solutions to partially ambiguous problems, such as analyzing a set of data for patterns and information or building upon an existing code base.**
1. Identify and use programming language constructs and coding patterns, such as iteration, methods, classes, arrays, fencepost problems, and token-based processing.
1. Break down problems into logical pieces using repetition, methods, and classes.
1. Test and debug solutions until they meet specifications.
1. Examine and compare reasoning, design, and effectiveness of alternative solutions.

### Course Outline and Topics
Key topics:
1. Primitive data and syntax
1. Definite loops
1. Conditional execution
1. Program logic
1. Indefinite loops
1. File processing
1. Arrays
1. Classes
1. Inheritance
1. ArrayLists

Optional:
- Graphics
- Big Data
- Recursion

## [CS143](143/) Computer Science II - Java (CS2)
This course is a continuation of Computer Science fundamentals. Topics include: a more in-depth look at object oriented programming, data abstraction and implementation, including ADTs (abstract data types), stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, predefined collection classes , recursion, complexity, searching and sorting.

### Outcomes
1. **Design and implement solutions to ambiguous problems.**
1. Read and write code using _Object Oriented Programming_ principles, including: _classes_, _Objects_, _encapsulation_, _inheritance_ and _interfaces_
1. Implement, utilize, and compare _List_ implementations (_Array_ and _Node_)
1. Implement, utilize, and compare _Collection_ interfaces and classes, including: _abstractions_ (_List_, _Set_, _Map_, _Stack_, _Queue_) and _implementations_ (_Hash Table_ and _Tree_)
1. Read and write _recursive methods_, including _recursive tracing_ and _helper functions_
1. Process data, including: _searching_ and _sorting_
1. Analyze code in regards to _complexity_, _performance analysis_, and _dynamic memory management_

### Course Outline and Topics
1. Collections
1. Recursion
1. Searching and Sorting
1. Stacks and Queues
1. Implementing a Collections class
1. Linked Lists
1. Binary Trees

Optional:
- Specific language features to facilitate key topics
- Graphical user interfaces
- Recursive backtracking
- Functional programming

## [CS211](211/) Computing and Society
This course explores issues related to the development, usage, and impact of computing technology on society. Students will explore the topics through class activities that involve gathering evidence, monitoring news, researching background materials, participating in discussion, and presenting findings. Students are not expected to have any specific expertise in digital technology beyond common public usage (email, web surfing, text message, word processing, and device usage).
Course Outcomes

### Outcomes
1. Identify the connections between computers, ethics, power, and society
