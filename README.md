# Shoreline Computer Science Courses

## [CS121](121/) Introduction to Programming - Python (Pre-CS1, CS0)
This course provides an introduction to computer programming. Explore foundational programming constructs, such as variables, functions, decisions, loops, and lists. Explore foundational programming concepts, such as problem solving, testing, and debugging. This course is intended for students with little to no prior programming experience.

### Outcomes
1. **Develop solutions to small-scale problems given an algorithm, such as computing the cost of an item dependent on a few variable choices or calculating and applying a curve to a classroom of grades.**
1. Examine and explain syntax, semantics, and practical effects of programming statements and procedures.
1. Identify and use programming language constructs such as sequence, selection, iteration, and procedures.
1. Recognize and use test cases to verify that solutions meet specifications.
1. Examine and compare reasoning, design, and effectiveness of alternative solutions.

### Course Outline and Topics
Key topics:
1. Introduction to computing (hardware, software, algorithms)
1. Variables, Expressions, Statements
1. Functions
1. Conditionals
1. Loops
1. String and string operations
1. Lists

Optional:
- Programming Robots
- Graphics

## [CS141](141/) Computer Science I - Java (CS1)
This course will explore common computational problem-solving techniques useful to computer scientists, but also to anyone who has large data sets, repetitive processes or other needs for computation.

Due to the amount of material and quick pace for consumption, prior programming experience is expected.

### Outcomes
1. **Develop solutions to small-scale problems, such as determining the best candidate for an admissions process, analyzing text for keywords, or playing a game of word guess.**
1. **Design and implement solutions to partially ambiguous problems, such as analyzing a set of data for patterns and information or building upon an existing code base.**
1. Identify and use programming language constructs and coding patterns, such as iteration, methods, classes, arrays, fencepost problems, and token-based processing.
1. Break down problems into logical pieces using repetition, methods, and classes.
1. Test and debug solutions until they meet specifications.
1. Examine and compare reasoning, design, and effectiveness of alternative solutions.

### Course Outline and Topics
Key topics:
1. Primitive data and syntax
1. Definite loops
1. Conditional execution
1. Program logic
1. Indefinite loops
1. File processing
1. Arrays
1. Classes
1. Inheritance
1. ArrayLists

Optional:
- Graphics
- Big Data
- Recursion

## [CS143](143/) Computer Science II - Java (CS2)

### Outcomes
1. **Design and implement solutions to ambiguous problems.**
1. Analyze and explain syntax, semantics, and practical effects of programming statements and procedures.
1. Recognize and use coding patterns and programming data structures such as lists, trees, stacks and queues.
1. Recognize and use test cases to verify that solutions meet specifications.
1. Analyze reasoning, design and effectiveness of alternative solutions.
