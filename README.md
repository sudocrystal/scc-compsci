# Shoreline Computer Science Courses

[Shoreline's Computer Science Program](https://www.shoreline.edu/engineering-computerscience-dept/)

## Core Sequence

### CS 110 Introduction to Programming - Python (Pre-CS1, CS0)
Use a computer language such as Python to learn programming, problem solving, analysis, modular design & debugging - concepts for all programming languages. No prior programming experience needed. Topics: syntax, classes, data types, control flow, loops, if, procedures, parameters, output & arrays. Previously: CS 121

### [CS141](141/) Computer Science I - Java (CS1)
Design and implement computer solutions using object oriented technology. Data types, algorithms, abstraction, classes, methods, inheritance, exceptions, arrays, control structures, sorting and searching.

### [CS143](143/) Computer Science II - Java (CS2)
This course is a continuation of Computer Science fundamentals. Students explore a deeper look at object-oriented programming. Data abstraction and implementation topics include abstract data types, stacks queues, linked lists, trees, predefined collection classes, recursion, complexity, searching, and sorting.

## Electives

### [CS090](090/) Independent Study Computer Science
Students study computer science topics individually or in small groups using the Computer Science and Engineering Learning Center. This course is an opportunity for tutorial instruction, exploration of available campus resources, and college success topics. No appointments are necessary. 

### [CS211](211/) Computing and Society
This course explores issues related to the development, usage, and impact of computing technology on society. Students will engage in critical thinking about computing by gathering evidence, monitoring news, researching controversial topics, participating in discussion, and presenting findings and conclusions.

### CS 151 Object Oriented Design: C++ Data Structures
This course is an optional continuation of Computer Science Fundamentals and an introduction to C++ for those familiar with object-oriented programming in Java. The class covers beginning memory management concepts, standard C++ library data structures, command-line debugging, and cross-language evaluation of program designs.
