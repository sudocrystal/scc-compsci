# Shoreline Computer Science Courses

## Core Sequence

### [CS121](121/) Introduction to Programming - Python (Pre-CS1, CS0)
This course provides an introduction to computer programming. Students explore foundational programming constructs such as variables, functions, decisions, loops, and lists as well as foundational concepts such as problem solving, testing, and debugging. This course is intended for students with little to no prior programming experience. 

Prerequisite: Placement into ENGL& 101 and completion of MATH 099 with grade of 2.0 or better. Student option grading.

### [CS141](141/) Computer Science I - Java (CS1)
This course will explore common computational problem-solving techniques. Students explore fundamental programming abilities and concepts including procedural programming (methods, parameters, return, values), control structures (sequence, if/else, for loop, while loop), file processing, arrays, and an introduction to objects. 

Prerequisite: ENGL& 101 (may be taken concurrently). Completion of MATH& 141 or MATH 111 with grades of 2.0 or better. Completion of CS 121 or ENGR 102 with a grade of 2.0 or better. Prior programming experience required. Mandatory decimal grading.

### [CS143](143/) Computer Science II - Java (CS2)
This course is a continuation of Computer Science fundamentals. Students explore a deeper look at object-oriented programming. Data abstraction and implementation topics include abstract data types, stacksm queues, linked lists, trees, predefined collection classes, recursion, complexity, searching, and sorting. 

Prerequisite: Completion of CS& 141 with a grade of 2.0 or better. Student option grading.
