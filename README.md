# Shoreline Computer Science Courses

## Core Sequence

### [CS121](121/) Introduction to Programming - Python (Pre-CS1, CS0)
Use a computer language such as Python to learn programming, problem solving, analysis, modular design & debugging - concepts for all programming languages. No prior programming experience needed. Topics: syntax, classes, data types, control flow, loops, if, procedures, parameters, output & arrays.
