# Lab: Madlibs

## Topics
This program will require using variables, user input, and print statements.

## Instructions
You are going to create a MadLib game! MadLibs is a game where you ask someone for a series of types of words and then you put them together in a story. Usually this story is silly or non-sensical.

Here is [an online example](http://www.madtakes.com/).

## Instructions
- Create a MadLib program that accepts input from the user and outputs a completed MadLib story
- Input
  - Use _at least three_ different parts of speech in order to fill in your story
  - Get at least _eight_ words or phrases from the user
- Output
  - Should consist of a paragraph of output that has the user’s input substituted into the story
  - At least one word or phrase must be used twice
  - At least one word or phrase must appear in UPPERCASE but may not be input in this format (i.e. you must convert it to uppercase)
    - **You must google how to do this.**

## Example Output
Below is an example output from running through a MadLib exercise. Don’t forget, your code and MadLib should be unique to you!

```
Welcome to my MadLib program.

Please enter in some information below:
name > Starr
adjective > huge
noun > tablecloth
adjective > dry
food (plural) > tacos
noun (plural) > packs

HERE'S YOUR MADLIB.......

Come on over to Starr’s Pizza Parlor where you can enjoy your favorite huge-dish pizza!
You can try our famous tablecloth-lovers pizza,
or select from our list of dry toppings,
including delicious tacos, packs, and many more.
Our crusts are hand-grabbed and basted by Starr to make
them even tastier.

OH JELLYFISH, I know you'll love it!
```

## TOTALLY OPTIONAL Added Fun
- Explore Python's other built in methods for [String](https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=upper#string-methods) like `title`, `capitalize`, `swapcase`, and utilize them accordingly
- Ask for at least 1 number and repeat the phrase that many times
