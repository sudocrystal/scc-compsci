## Classroom Contract
Thirty percent of your grade will be based on your ability to uphold the classroom contract as follows:
- **Be Prepared**: You are expected to complete all pre-work and homework before class starts so that you are ready to be engaged in conversations and activities.
- **Be Present**: You are expected to be in class, on time, and actively present in the learning process.
- **Participate**: You are expected to be an active contributor in class. This means both asking questions and helping others.
  + Do you make at least one contribution (e.g. insight or question) to each class without monopolizing discussion?
  + Do you give active non-verbal and verbal feedback?
  + Do you refer to other students by name and react to their contributions?
